# Repository Guidelines

`AGENTS.md` is the single source of truth for repository-level agent instructions. Any agent-specific instruction file must reference this file instead of duplicating guidance.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This is a Bun monorepo with `apps/*` workspaces:

- `apps/frontend/` — React + Vite UI. Components in `src/components/` (design system in `src/components/ui/`), features in `src/features/`, hooks in `src/hooks/`, routes in `src/routes/`, and tests in `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/support/`.
- `apps/api/` — Elysia server with Kysely/SQLite persistence. Routes in `src/routes/`, services in `src/services/`, plugins in `src/plugins/`, database layer in `src/db/`, and tests in `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/support/`.
- `apps/shared/` — Framework-agnostic shared types in `src/types/`, API contracts in `src/contracts/`, i18n dictionaries in `src/i18n/`, shared test helpers in `src/test-utils/`, and workspace tests in `tests/unit/`.

Runtime artifacts (`dist/`, `uploads/`, `*.sqlite`, `bun.lock`) are gitignored and should not be committed.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `bun install`: install all workspace dependencies.
- `bun run dev`: start all dev servers concurrently.
- `bun run dev:api`: start API server on `http://localhost:3001`.
- `bun run dev:frontend`: start frontend dev server on `http://localhost:5173`.
- `bun run build`: build the frontend with Vite.
- `bun run lint`: run TypeScript type-checking + ESLint across all workspaces.
- `bun run test`: run all unit and integration suites from the monorepo root.
- `bun run test:unit`: run API, shared, and frontend unit suites.
- `bun run test:integration`: run API and frontend integration suites.
- `bun run test:coverage`: run frontend coverage with Vitest.
- `bun run migrate`: run database migrations in the API workspace.
- `bun run clean`: remove all `dist/` directories.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use TypeScript throughout and follow the existing style: 2-space indentation, single quotes, and semicolons. Use `PascalCase` for React components and exported types, `camelCase` for variables and functions, and `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants. Prefer descriptive names over abbreviations, keep functions focused, and add JSDoc to exported utilities or other public APIs. Use the `@/` alias for root-relative imports in the frontend workspace.

Any hook file that contains JSX (e.g., a Provider component) must use the `.tsx` extension. The OXC parser in Vite 8 rejects JSX in `.ts` files.

## i18n Conventions

All UI strings must come from `@mangostudio/shared/i18n`. Never hardcode user-visible strings in components.

- Source of truth: `apps/shared/src/i18n/pt-BR.ts` (uses `as const`)
- English fallback: `apps/shared/src/i18n/en.ts` (annotated `: Messages` — compile error if a key is missing)
- Frontend access: `const { t } = useI18n()` from `@/hooks/use-i18n`
- API error messages: import `ptBR` from `@mangostudio/shared/i18n`

## Testing Guidelines

The repository uses an automated workspace-first test suite under `apps/*/tests`. Before opening a PR, run `bun run lint`, `bun run test`, `bun run test:coverage`, `bun run build`, and smoke-test the main flows locally: login, chat creation, image generation.

**API integration tests** — always use `createApiTestApp(routePlugin)` from `tests/support/harness/create-api-test-app.ts`. Route plugins use `.group('/path', ...)` without the `/api` prefix (that prefix lives in `app.ts`). Test URLs must match the route's group path directly (e.g., `/settings/models/gemini`, not `/api/settings/models/gemini`). Validate response shapes with `Value.Check(Schema, payload)` from `@sinclair/typebox/value`.

**Frontend fetch mocks** — `create-fetch-scenario.ts` is for React hook tests in jsdom only (hooks that call `fetch` via Eden Treaty). For API contract tests, use `createApiTestApp` + `app.handle()` in the API workspace.

Place new tests in the appropriate workspace under `tests/unit/` or `tests/integration/`, and keep reusable support code in `tests/support/` only when it removes real duplication.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Use short imperative commit subjects such as `Add gallery empty state`. Keep each commit scoped to one concern. PRs should summarize the user-visible change, list verification steps, mention any new environment variables or schema changes, and include screenshots or GIFs for UI updates.

A `.gitmessage` template is available at the repo root as the canonical format reference for commit subjects and bodies (type, scope, description, what's changed, how it improves the app). Configure it locally once with:

```bash
git config commit.template .gitmessage
```

## Configuration

All configuration lives under `.mango/`. Copy the example files to get started:

```bash
cp .mango/config.toml.example .mango/config.toml
cp .mango/.env.example .mango/.env
```

Resolution hierarchy (highest priority wins):
1. `.mango/.env` — overrides matching keys from config.toml (best for secrets)
2. `config.toml` — dev: `./.mango/config.toml` | build: `~/.mango/config.toml`
3. Built-in defaults in the application code

Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.mango/.env` or add named keys under `[gemini_api_keys]` in `config.toml`. The API key is only accessed server-side. Never commit populated config files. Validate uploaded files and request payloads, and log errors with enough context for debugging instead of swallowing them silently.
